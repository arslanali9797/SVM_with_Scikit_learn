# SVM_with_Scikit_learn
## In this project we are going to indentify the personality through machine learning where we use support vector machine with scikit learn. the dataset is alredy provide inside the scikit learn librery.The project is also cover the  deployment phase in local host .This project is going to  predict the personality with image.

# Dependencies
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from matplotlib import image


from PIL import Image


import numpy as np


import cv2 


# Introduction 

This project is based on image classification,where different personalities images are used to train the model. After that we will identify the image with their name.To achive our purpose we are going to implement the Scikit librery with SVM(support vector Machine )
we know that SVMs are a powerful class of supervised learning algorithms for classification and regression problems. In the context of classification, SVMs can be viewed as maximum margin linear classifiers.We will also give you an oppertunity to deploy this over the localhost with the help of Flask plartform .No need to wory about data set the file will automatically download the datased from scikit learn librery .

### Now the time to follow the procedure to run the project

## step 1 
first your have to download all the necessary librery to successfully run the file .All libreries are mentioned above.

## step 2
now clone or download  the project at your work place .

## step 3 ( Download Dataset)
This is mandatory step, make sure that the ipynb file run successfully .if ipynb file run successful then the dataset will be download automatically for that we use scikit learn.Scikit learn contain some dataset so we use that dataset one of them . File contain codes and description and comments, if you want to know more detail about code go for the links

## step 4
After successfully running the file ,we train our model with images .we use Scikit learn along svm to identify the name by given input images. Our model is trained and it will give you the name of personality of that image you have given .
## step 5
